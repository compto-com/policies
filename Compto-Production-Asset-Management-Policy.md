# Compto Public Benefit Corporation Production Access Management Program: Compliance and Supervisory Procedures

## 1. Purpose and Scope

This process governs how individuals within the organization request
access to production systems and data, how those requests are assessed
and approved, how access is periodically reviewed, and how it is
ultimately revoked when no longer necessary. The scope covers any
production environment or sensitive data repository managed by the
company, ensuring proper authorization and adherence to the principle of
least privilege.

## 2. Roles and Responsibilities

-   **CSO (Chief Security Officer):** Oversees the entire access control
    process, makes final determinations on high-risk requests, and
    ensures adherence to security policies.

-   **Requestor:** An individual requiring access to production systems
    or data for legitimate business purposes.

-   **System/Data Owner:** The person with primary responsibility for a
    given production asset or dataset. Reviews and recommends whether
    access should be granted.

-   **Approver (could be the CSO or delegated manager):** Reviews access
    requests, validates business needs, and formally grants or denies
    requests.

## 3. Access Request

1.  **Identify Need:** The requestor determines they require access to a
    specific production system or dataset for a clear, legitimate
    business purpose.

2.  **Submit Request:** The requestor completes a standardized access
    request form (e.g., through a ticketing system or a designated
    email) that includes:

    -   Name, role, and department of the requestor
    -   Specific assets or data to which access is needed
    -   Justification for the request (business need)
    -   Duration of access if temporary

3.  **Routing to Appropriate Owner/Approver:** The completed form is
    sent to the System/Data Owner and/or the designated Approver (who
    may be the CSO for critical assets).

## 4. Approval Process

1.  **Verification of Business Need:** The Approver (in consultation
    with the System/Data Owner if needed) verifies that the access
    request is valid and necessary.

2.  **Risk Assessment:** For sensitive systems or data, the Approver
    assesses the level of risk involved, considering factors such as
    data sensitivity and potential impact on production stability.

3.  **Decision and Notification:**

    -   If approved, the Approver documents the approval and notifies
        the requestor and relevant stakeholders (e.g., the CSO).

    -   If denied, the Approver provides a brief explanation to the
        requestor.

## 5. Access Provisioning (Granting Access)

1.  **Assign Permissions:** The approved level of access is applied
    according to the principle of least privilege, granting only the
    specific rights needed.

2.  **Document Changes:** The CSO or a designated administrator records
    the new access level in an access control list or centralized
    management tool.

3.  **Implementation Confirmation:** The requestor is notified that
    their access has been granted. They must verify that the permissions
    align with what was requested and approved (no more, no less).

## 6. Periodic Access Review

1.  **Scheduled Reviews:** At predefined intervals (e.g., quarterly),
    the CSO or System/Data Owner reviews all user permissions.

2.  **Verification of Ongoing Need:** Each permission is assessed to
    confirm that it still matches the user's job requirements.

3.  **Adjustment:** If any access is deemed unnecessary, it is revoked
    or adjusted to align with current needs.

4.  **Documentation:** The reviewer documents any changes made during
    the access review in the relevant tracking system.

## 7. Access Revocation

1.  **Trigger for Revocation:** Access may be revoked due to role
    changes, project completion, contract termination, or periodic
    review findings.

2.  **Notification and Logging:** When the decision to revoke is made,
    the user is notified if appropriate. The revocation is logged in the
    access tracking tool for audit purposes.

3.  **Immediate Revocation for Security Risks:** If an urgent security
    concern arises (e.g., suspicious activity or policy violation), the
    CSO may revoke access immediately without prior notice.

## 8. Documentation and Audit

1.  **Centralized Logging:** All access requests, approvals, and
    revocations are documented in a secure, centralized system for
    auditing and compliance purposes.

2.  **Audit Trail Maintenance:** The CSO ensures that logs are retained
    for an appropriate period to support investigations, compliance
    reviews, or incident response activities.

## 9. Continuous Improvement

1.  **Policy Updates:** Feedback and lessons learned from each access
    request or review cycle inform revisions to this process.

2.  **Training and Awareness:** The CSO provides regular training for
    staff on how to request and manage access securely.

3.  **Automation:** Where feasible, automated workflows and policy-based
    controls are adopted to streamline requests, approvals, and
    revocations, reducing the chance of human error.

By following these steps, the organization ensures that access to
production assets and data is carefully controlled, granted only to
those with a legitimate business need, regularly reviewed, and promptly
revoked when no longer necessary.

## 10. Senior Manager Approval

I have approved this Production Asset Management Policy as reasonably
designed to achieve and monitor our firm's ongoing compliance with the
requirements of Production Asset Management standards and regulations.
